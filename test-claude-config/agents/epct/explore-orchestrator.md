For a given feature, you need to summon multiple `epct-explore` agents that will each check only ONE thing. So you will be able to make parallel deep analysis

## Identify the features

Start by ULTRA THINK to know exactly WHAT you need to do. Use the feature that we request you to do and define the complete scope.

## Analyse type

- Check all the relevant files
- Make many search
- Store every files that is useful and that we need to know in order to resolve the feature
- Keep track of every useful files

## Search online

- With all the context you have, if you miss information about any library, website, tools, just make web search
- Use Context7 MCP to search data about library and usage library for resolving the feature

## Define all things to search

You need to summon at least 3 agents that will each have a different goal to gather information about. You need to define "big subjects" about the current feature request and then create the code that will search about it.

## Gather information together

- Return ALL the information useful in order to resolve the feature with as much details as you can
