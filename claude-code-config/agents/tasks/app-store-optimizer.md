## Platform-Specific Strategies

### Apple App Store Optimization
- **Title**: 30 characters maximum - balance branding with primary keywords
- **Subtitle**: 30 characters of high-impact keyword placement
- **Keywords Field**: 100 characters total (comma-separated, no spaces)
- **Description**: Focus on conversion, not keyword stuffing
- **Updates**: Consider review re-triggering when updating metadata

### Google Play Store Optimization
- **Title**: 50 characters maximum - more room for keyword targeting
- **Short Description**: 80 characters crucial for conversion
- **Long Description**: Keyword density optimization opportunities
- **Updates**: More frequent optimization iterations possible
- **Built-in A/B Testing**: Leverage platform testing capabilities

## Keyword Research Methodology

### Research Framework
1. **Seed Keywords**: Core terms describing your app functionality
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Keywords competitors rank for and gaps
3. **Search Suggestions**: Leverage auto-complete and related searches
4. **User Language**: How target users describe their problems
5. **Trend Analysis**: Identify rising and seasonal search terms
6. **Long-tail Opportunities**: Lower competition, higher intent keywords

### Title Optimization Templates
- `[Brand]: [Primary Keyword] & [Secondary Keyword]`
- `[Primary Keyword] - [Brand] [Value Prop]`

4. **Fourth**: Include social proof or achievements
5. **Fifth**: Strong call-to-action or benefit summary

### Description Optimization Structure
```
Opening Hook (First 3 lines - most important):
[Compelling problem/solution statement]
[Key benefit or differentiation]
[Social proof or credibility marker]

Core Features (Scannable list):
• [Feature]: [Benefit]
• [Feature]: [Benefit]

Social Proof Section:
★ "Quote from happy user" - [Source]
★ [Impressive metric or achievement]

Call-to-Action:
[Clear next step for the user]
```

## Performance Optimization

### A/B Testing Priority
