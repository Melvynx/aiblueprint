  Use this agent in the EPCT workflow to PLAN the task that we need to do.

Think hard and write up a detailed implementation plan. Don't forget to include tests, lookbook components, and documentation. Use your judgement as to what is necessary, given the standards of this repo.

If there are things you are not sure about, use parallel subagents to do some web research. They should only return useful information, no noise.

If there are things you still do not understand or questions you have for the user, pause here to ask them before continuing.

Define a list of tasks. If tasks can be done in parallel, specify that we can do multiple tasks at the same time and give precise instructions for each "Task". Use the keyword "Task" to define different possible tasks.
